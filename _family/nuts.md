title: NUTS
family: nuts
---

The "NUTS" family of talkers all trace their origins back to the original _Neil's
Unix Talk Server_, written in C.  This lineage is probably the most prolific and
popular across the various codebases, simply based on the number of forks made.

A NUTS-style talker often defaulted to a "speech-first" mode, where entered text
was treated as normal chat text unless preceeded by a command or command shortcut
character. In speech mode, input lines that begin with a dot(`.`) immediately
followed by a command word were interpreted as commands that would either alter
the speech behavior (ex: `.shout`) or execute other functions in the world (e.g.
moving between rooms in the case of `.go`). An alternative "command mode" was
available for users who preferred a more MUD-like experience, where all input
began with a command word and "normal" speech required the use of the `say` command.

{% assign otherFamily = site.family | where: "family", "other" | first %}
This user experience was so popular that some of the [other talkers]({{ otherFamily.url }})
outside of the NUTS family adopted or emulated the dot-command input behavior along
with other features like markup formats for changing ANSI text and background colors
within user-entered text without requiring users to understand ANSI color codes.

{% assign nuts_faq = site.info | where: "key", "nuts-faq" | first %}

## License

On July 18, 2002, in the `alt.talkers` Usenet group, author Neil Robertson
[retroactively applied][nuts-gpl] the [GNU General Public License v2.0][gplv2]
to all original NUTS source code releases.  (Note: the GPL version was not explicitly
stated but, based on the date, GPLv2 is assumed since it was the latest version
available at the time.)

Presumably, the terms of the GPL license would apply to new derivative works based off
of the original NUTS code after that date, but forks and other derivative works that
already existed as of July 2002 (and also their derivatives, if any) would be
grandfathered under the previous terms of use.  However, this paragraph is not
legal advice; you are encouraged to seek proper legal counsel if you have questions
regarding the full implications of this retroactive assignment.

## NUTS History (also written by Neil)

NUTS started out as a university project in 1992 for the final year of my
degree course and it was the 2nd best option in my opinion from writing a MUD
which the CS department decided "wasn't appropriate". So I came up with
some specious title for a talker project along the lines of a "multiuser
realtime networked conferencing system" or some such bullshit and they
fell for it :) Having seen a number of other systems such as the complex
EW-TOO by Simon Marsh (which to me seemed to be inhabiting some middle ground 
between mud and talker), the very simple such as the talker built into Unaxcess
(sp?) and the truly appalling (did someone say IRC?) I designed NUTS as being 
a system that anyone would be able to master straight away the minute they 
logged in. These days its somewhat more complex and probably sits alongside 
EW-TOO in the talker stakes but hopefully its still just as easy to use for 
first timers.

These are the dates on which various nuts version were release as best I can
remember or find out...
