IFORMS, short for "Interactive FORum Multiplexor Software", was forked from NUTS 1.0.3.

Thanks goes to Andrew Collington for his submission to the archive. Unfortunately,
Andy was only able to provide a fragment of version 1.13 (circa May 1995) consisting
of the `iforms.c` source code file, but without any headers or other runtime files
and documentation.
