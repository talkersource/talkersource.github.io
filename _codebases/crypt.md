A notable feature of _Crypt_ was its ability to compile and run on versions of Microsoft
Windows (95/NT4) common in its era -- something practically unheard of in the Talker space,
making this a very unique codebase.

The archive contains two branches; the default `crypt/v5` branch contains an original
distribution of version 5.0, later patched with C source and header files for version 5.3.
The `rick-collette/6.x` branch contains a newer version of this codebase; it was retrieved
from his [sourceforge.net project][sf] but contains code not written by Crypt's original
author(s).
