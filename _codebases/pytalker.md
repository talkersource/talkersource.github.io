PyTalker was started by the same author who forked [_{{ mamnuts.title }}_]({{ mamnuts.url }}) and
would later create [_{{ talkernode.title }}_]({{ talkernode.url }}). All behave in the style of
[{{ nutsFamily.title }}-family]({{ nutsFamily.url }}) talkers, but PyTalker uses the Python
language and is not derived from the original NUTS source code in C.
